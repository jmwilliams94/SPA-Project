SPA-Project

This Project is to create a SPA (Single Page Application) which must have the following requirements.

1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

2. 
Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. 
Some interactivity is required. This interactivity needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
